# "Bag of Words meets Bags of Popcorn" Kaggle tutorial

## What ?

My attempt at this [Kaggle tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial), to learn the Google's [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) package implementations for word representations as vectors (see *Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, and Jeffrey Dean. Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space. CoRR, abs/1301.3781, 2013.*)

## Who ?

Just me, with the provided help from Kaggle, like [this repo](https://github.com/wendykan/DeepLearningMovies).

## Why ?

Acquiring knowledge about *Natural Language Processing*, and more specifically to dive into the complex field of *Sentiment Analysis*.

## How ?

To run the Python code in this repo, you'll need the following packages :

+ [NumPy 1.9.2](http://www.numpy.org/)
